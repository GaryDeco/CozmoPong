## Development Notes

**Version 1**:
*  Based on a few tutorials as I am getting the hang of Pygame.
* A lot of bloat in the code and some redundancy. 
* Some functions added to clean up the game loop as it was getting messy.
  
**Version 2:**
* Added scoring display and offsets
* Added score limit
* Added scalers for paddle and ball for dynamic resizing if screen dims are changed.
* Added spund effects
* Added background music (only for personal use!, clipped from you tube)
* Game is fully functional with AI responding (not ideally but working)
* Needs improved AI
* Needs more robust ball collisions i.e. angle adjustments based on impact location on paddle. 
* One player only currently but 2 player option will be added. 

**Todo's:**
* Make a splash screen and menu
* Add sprite sheet for some better visuals
* Add some enhanced effects i.e. ball trail and impact effect on paddle
* ~~Add sound effects~~
* ~~Add background music~~
* Add scoring log to keep track of players and achievements. 
* Make an executable
* Add joystick and controller support (partiallly tested already)
* Run some AI experiments to see what I can come up with. 
* Possibly incorporate PyOpenGL for some experimental features.
